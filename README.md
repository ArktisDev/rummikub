# rummikub
The game Rummikub implemented in Mathematica

This was part of a 7 week class project I undertook my freshman year of college. For this class we were meant to solve computational/mathematical problems using the programming language Mathematica. For our final project we decided to create the game Rummikub, as well as an AI to play it with.

Looking back now on some of the code in this project, it is clear to me that I have learned a lot and would code a majority of it differently were I to do it again.

In order to view the notebook you will need to download the notebook file and open using Mathematica. Mathematica 11 was used to create this, no guarantees that it still be working in Mathematica 12 and beyond.
